## Market data
1 minute resolution OHLCV bars for all watched instruments are stored with MongoDB (or please write your own DB wrapper and submit a pull request). 

Software currently works for 1Min+ resolution strategies with tick-resolution strategy support planned later. With this in mind, the software converts tick data to 1 min bars where live tick data is available, but doesn't store ticks locally (i.e. it can handle tick data but doesnt yet use it).
 
## Strategy modelling
Strategy implementations are not included. A simple moving average cross model is included as a guide only. 
Custom strategy implementations, collaboration or any other enquiries: sam@sdbgroup.io.

## Collaboration
Pull requests and discussion regarding new features are very welcome, please reach out.
